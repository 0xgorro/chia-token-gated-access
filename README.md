# chia-token-gated-access
Token gated access functionality built on the Chia blockchain.
The idea is to utilize primitives already in Chialisp and those coming in Q2 of 2023 to enable a backbone of universal token gated access control for use in e.g. web2 and web3 SaaS-websites, Discord servers and channels, Telegram group chats etc.
